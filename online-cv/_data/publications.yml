  - title: "Sparse Merkle Trees: A mutable data structure for TXO commitments"
    abstract: |
      This Request for Comment (RFC) proposes replacing the current Mutable Merkle Mountain Range (MMMR) data structure
      used for tracking the commitment to the UTXO set, with a Sparse Merkle tree (SMT).

  - title: "Non-interactive protocols for Mimblewimble"
    description: |
     <p>Mimblewimble is a scalable, lightweight, private cryptocurrency protocol. One of its drawbacks is that transactions
     are interactive, meaning that the sender and receiver must communicate in order to complete the transaction.</p>
     <p>Learn how Tari managed to add scripting into Mimblewimble to allow non-interactive transactions to take place.</p>
