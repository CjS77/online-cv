      <p>Tari is a privacy-focused digital assets protocol.</p>
      <p>Tari resolves the blockchain trilemma by employing a two-layer architecture. The base layer is a
      Mimblewimble-based cryptocurrency secured by proof-of-work. The second layer is a Byzantine Fault
      Tolerant (BFT) self-sharding assets protocol with Turing-complete smart contract capabilities focused
      on scaling and performance.

      Big Neon is a modern, mobile-first platform that moves beyond just selling tickets.
      It helps music promoters increase revenue and compete in the secondary sales
      market.
      Starting June 2018, my brief was to build an engineering team and deliver the first
      go-to-market version of Big Neon in 9 months. The first Big Neon tickets were
      sold in January 2019. Big Neon realised over $2 million dollars in sales before the
      Covid-19 pandemic shut down all events in the U.S. and abroad and effectively
      killed Big Neon as a going concern.
